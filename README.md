Insect Population Analysis & Prediction
This project focuses on predicting insect populations using environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and location-based data. We employ machine learning techniques, including regression analysis, to identify key environmental variables affecting insect counts.

Key Components:
Data Collection: Aggregating multi-location environmental data (temperature, humidity, etc.).
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying correlations and trends across multiple perspectives.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing regression models (linear, polynomial, etc.) and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast insect populations.
Model Evaluation: Using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess prediction accuracy.
This project aims to enhance environmental monitoring and optimize data-driven decision-making in
