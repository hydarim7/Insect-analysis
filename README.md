# **Insect Population Analysis & Prediction**  

---

### **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **predicting insect populations** using environmental factors such as **temperature, humidity, and location-based data**. We employ **machine learning techniques**, including **regression analysis**, to identify key environmental variables affecting insect counts.  

---

### **Key Components**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Data Collection:** Multi-location environmental data (temperature, humidity, etc.).  
- ðŸ”¹ **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.  
- ðŸ”¹ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Identifying correlations and trends.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing **regression models (linear, polynomial, etc.)** and **machine learning algorithms** (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- ðŸ”¹ **Model Evaluation:** Using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to assess accuracy.
