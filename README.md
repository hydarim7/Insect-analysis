# **Insect Population Analysis & Prediction**  

---

### **üìå Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **predicting insect populations** using environmental factors such as **temperature, humidity, and location-based data**. We employ **machine learning techniques** and **statistical analysis**, including **regression models, correlation studies, and hypothesis testing**, to identify key environmental variables affecting insect counts.  

Additionally, we leverage **Power BI** for interactive **data visualization**, enabling better trend analysis and data-driven decision-making.

### **üìä Key Analytical Components**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- Multi-location data, including **temperature, humidity, and insect count trends**.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and normalizing data distributions.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new predictive variables based on statistical insights.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of insect populations across locations.  
- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  - Pearson and Spearman correlation between insect counts and environmental factors.  
  - Identifying multicollinearity among features.  
- **Hypothesis Testing:**  
  - **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** to determine if insect populations differ significantly across regions.  
  - **Chi-square test** for categorical variable associations.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling & Statistical Techniques**  
- **Regression Models:**  
  - **Linear Regression:** Understanding trends in insect population changes.  
  - **Polynomial Regression:** Capturing non-linear relationships.  
  - **Multiple Regression:** Analyzing the impact of multiple environmental factors simultaneously.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - **Random Forest, XGBoost** for more accurate predictions.  
  - **Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM)** to predict future insect counts.  
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **R¬≤ Score, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE** to measure predictive accuracy.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization with Power BI**  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Exploring insect distribution across locations.  
- **Heatmaps & Boxplots:** Identifying extreme values and trends.  
- **Time-Series Charts:** Visualizing insect population fluctuations over time.
